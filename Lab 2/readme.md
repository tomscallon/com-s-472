This project uses a Makefile to compile and run.

### Compiling

To compile, simply run `make` directly inside the `Lab 2` directory.

### Running

To run Othello, just run `make run` directly inside the `Lab 2` directory. The program will prompt you to indicate what kind of players should participate. Once this is done, the game will begin.

**Note:** Within the `main` function (inside `main.cpp`), there are two commented out sections of code (starting with `auto results` and ending after the outer of two for-loops). Uncomment the first section to run an automated test of alpha-beta agents with varying search depths. Uncomment the second the run an automated test of the first evaluation function against the second. This is the code that was run to achieve results quoted in the report.
